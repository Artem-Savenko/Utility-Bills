## About this program
This program was created to manage all utility bill payments in one place and allow the user to quickly make a summary of chosen utility bill entries.
At any time you can add, rename or delete houses, bill types and single utility bill entries.

## How to use this program
* Add a house (address) for which you want to manage your utility bills by clicking the `New` button.
* Add a bill type by clicking little the `+` button below the house (address) field. Give it a name, for example "Electricity".
* Click on `Electricity` button that appeared to select this bill type.
* Click on `+` button which is located on `Month` header to add a single-month entry. A single-month entry represents utility usage from first day of the month to the last day of the month.
* Double-click the month name in order to change it.
* In the field `Beginning of the month`, enter the number from your water meter on the first day of the month. Do the same for `End of the month` at the end of the month.
* Set the price of one unit.
* `Total (units)` and `Total (cost)` will be calculated automatically.

## Summary view
To add a utility bill entry to the summary, just right click on the entry you want to add and click "Add to summary". When you have added all the desired entries, click the `Summary view` icon in the top right corner of the window.
